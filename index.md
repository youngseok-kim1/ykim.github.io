Our group explores the intersection of hardware and algorithm co-optimization, with a particular focus on quantum computing systems. We investigate:

- **Efficient algorithm execution on hardware** under realistic noise conditions.
- **Identification of critical hardware non-idealities** that impact algorithm performance, and their origins through device-level benchmarking.
- **Mitigation of hardware imperfections** via joint hardware and algorithm optimization strategies.

We are currently establishing a small-scale superconducting qubit characterization laboratory. This facility will serve as a platform for in-depth exploration of hardware non-idealities in quantum systems.

In parallel, we collaborate with theorists and algorithm researchers to develop and evaluate practical algorithm optimization techniques. These efforts include running large-scale experiments on quantum hardware provided by external vendors.
